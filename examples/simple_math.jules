# Jules Math Example

# Basic variables
x is 10
y is 5

# Basic operations
show "x + y = " + (x + y)
show "x - y = " + (x - y)
show "x * y = " + (x * y)
show "x / y = " + (x / y)

# Compound assignment
result is x + y
show "Result: " + result

# Booleans
is_greater is x > y
show "Is x greater than y? " + is_greater
